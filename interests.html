      <h1>My Interests</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Even though every aspect of programming is fascinating in it's own, there are some platform or technologies that
          interests me more than the other. Such things can be divded into two categories:
          <br />
          Things that I am familiar with:
          <ul>
            <li> <b>Systems Programming:</b>
              There is this joy about writing a fast compiled code, that interpreted languages
              fail to provide. Writing fast, secure and reliable software using languages like Rust is every system enthusiasts dream.</li>
            <li> <b>Native Applications using API:</b>
              My love for systems programming gives birth to my interest in writing Native applications for web services. Having fast access to frequent apps without opening a web engine every single time has a charm of it's own.
            </li>
            <li><b>Command Line Interface:</b>
              Althoug using terminal for most of your tasks may feel a little bit archaic to some people,
              once you get used to it's consistency and simplicity, you would not want to leave it. For more complex tasks, Terminal User Interfaces covers most of my daily requirements.</li>
          </ul>
          Things that I am interested in, but never got a chance to indulge in:
          <ul>
            <li> <b>Web Applications:</b>
              Let me explain.... Even though I like native software more than it's web conterparts, the current trend in programming seems to be shifting more toward web based technologies. Also, observing electron based applications like VSCode and Atom achieve performance near their native counterparts opens up a new gateway of how we make cross platform software from a single source.</li>
            <li> <b>Networking and Security:</b>
              With the recent ongoings in the world, work from home has become an integral part of many software developer's daily life. Thus I think it is necessay to learn how data is transmitted securely to a remote workspace and how to manage such connections.</li>
            <li> <b>Video and Audio:</b>
            In the early days of internet in India, it was painstakingly difficult to watch a video on the internet in high definition even on a stable 3G network. Now a days the whole system works on making video calls and online conferences, without many problems. The advancement in low latency transmission of data and better video and audio compression not only provides a smooth experience, but also makes it an integral part of our daily lives.</li>
          </ul>
