      <h1>Just Some Miscellanueos Stuff:</h1>

          Here is some random information that no one asked for:
          <br />
          System Specifications:
          <ul>
            <li> <b>Laptop Model: Dell Inspiron 15-3567;</b> It is perfect for most of my programming needs. Although gaming can be a bit
            of a problem.</li>
            <li> <b>OS: Manjaro Linux;</b> As I tinker with my OS all the time, resetting arch after every system breaks takes a lot of time. Manjaro is a solid alternative in that regard. Also, bleeding edge software updates have a nice ring to it.</li>
            <li> <b>Shell: ZSH;</b> I wanted fish like autocompletion and syntax highlighting in my shell, but since Fish is not POSIX compliant, scripting can be a bit of a pain. Thus I stubled upon ZSH, and I have to admit, it makes using terminal even more pleasurable.</li>
            <li> <b>Window Manager: AwesomeWM;</b> When you spend most of your time in front of a screen opening and closing different appplications, having the layout catered to your tastes with a snappy interface makes you want to loath all those Desktop environments with tons of dependencies. Also, my system is slow, needs minimal softwares.</li>
            <li> <b>Terminal: Rxvt-Unicode;</b> I don't know if you have noticed, but my system is relativily slow compared to mordern laptops. When you use terminal most of the time, having a daemon running in the background, ready to spawn at any moment makes the workflow buttery smooth.</li>
            <li> <b>Editor/IDE: NVim/Emacs;</b> For quick editing a file, neovim is a pretty good terminal based solution for modal text editing. As for an IDE or a development environment, Emacs has all the things you could every ask for. Although support for some languages is not as good as the alternatives, using Magit for git and Org-mode makes it worth to use this fantasting piece of software. I use a preconfigured setup for Emacs called as Doom Emacs which provides an optimized configuration with Vim like key bindings.</li>
          </ul>
          <b> P.S.: This is my first website(?) that I made from scratch using HTML and CSS which can be called a project. It ain't much but it's honest work :) </b>
